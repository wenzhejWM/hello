Thanks Nick,
  
  I understand that Citadel pays very well and its advantages, but I can't imagine myself jumping to a very similar position where I do not find my passion. I know it's hard to get to a relatively traditional trading role, but what about algorithmic trading roles? For example, roles like algorithm developer at Hudson River Trading (ignore the developer title, they are actually developing trading strategies/algorithms), I've seen people with no trading experience working there. And what about Quant research roles? I remember you mentioned Two sigma and D.E.Shaw in our phone call, do you have some opportunities with them? I think I am a good fit for quant research given my two-year math research experience at University of Waterloo. Please let me know.
  
  Regards,
